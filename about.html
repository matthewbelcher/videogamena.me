<div class="size4 headline">ABOUT THE VIDEO GAME NAME GENERATOR</div>

<br>Now with <font color="dodgerblue">an awesome brand new layout</font>! Thanks Karla! If you notice any issues with it, please email me (my email is at the bottom of this page).

<br><br>Originally developed to fill in data for a college database project (thanks Professor Hammer!) the VGNG has blossomed over the last 5 years (through a few different forms) into the lovable little program you see on this website today.

<br><br><div class="headline">CURRENT STATS ON THE GENERATOR (AS OF SEPTEMBER 8TH, 2011):</div>
<br>519 1st words/phrases
<br>349 2nd words/phrases
<br>406 3rd words/phrases
<br>Approx. 73 million distinct possible names
<br>Longest name currently: The Harlem Globetrotters: of Might and Magic Crime Scene Investigation
<br>Shortest name currently: 3D (or DJ) DJ (or 3D) X (or Z)

<br><br>If you'd like to use the VGNG on your website, feel free! If you want to make your own version (or make a better one for me ;) ), the wordlist is called video_game_names.txt, and the syntax should be simple enough to figure out (three wordlists separated by dashes, with dupe protection listed after the "^" and separated by pipes "|".) I only ask that, if you copy the VGNG for your site, please don't use it for any profit-generating purpose (charging for it or selling ads), and include a link back to this site.

<br><br><div class="headline">Thanks go out to many folks:</div>
